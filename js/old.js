// LESSONS LEARNED
// * unsure where to place map display append
// * an extra text reference is extremely helpful
// * time management: don't assume the content is short / easy based on the number of course video units
// * a video or two walking through each template file in detail would have been very useful early in the basic javascript course
// * plan to modify the helper.js class to allow more .replacements (URLs, etc)
// * plan to swap out placeholder images (does anyone know of a good website image capture program?)
